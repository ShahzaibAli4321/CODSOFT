Hi! My name is Shahzaib Ali.
I am very thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed the first task of my first internship in C++ programming
Offered by "CODSOFT".

Task 2 : "Simple Calculator"

This is a simple console based calculator.
It is capable to perform simple mathematical operations like "Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.
The program asks the user to enter the first number,the operation to be performed and the second number respectively.
Then it performs the operation on the numbers accordingly and displays the result.

I have used switch statement to build up ths program.

If any operator other than (*,/,+,-) is entered by the user, the program displays an error.

A Math error is also displayed when a number is divided by 0.
