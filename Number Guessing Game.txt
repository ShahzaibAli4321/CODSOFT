Hi! My name is Shahzaib Ali.
I am very thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed the first task of my first internship in C++ programming
Offered by "CODSOFT".

Task 1 : "NUMBER GUESSING GAME"

this is a simple console based number guessing game.
The computer generates a random number and asks the user to guess the number.
if the user's guess is more then 100 numbers away from the number, the message "Too high!!!" or "T00 Low!!!" is shown.
if the user's guess is more then 10 numbers away from the number, the computer notifies the user about it.
if the user's guess is less then 10 numbers away from the number, the computer notifies the user by saying "You are very close".

As the user guesses the number correctly a congratulations message is shown along with a smiling face.

At last the computer asks the user if he/she wants to play again and prompts accordingly
