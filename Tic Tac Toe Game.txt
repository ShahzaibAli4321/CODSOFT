Hi! My name is Shahzaib Ali.
I am very thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed the first task of my first internship in C++ programming
Offered by "CODSOFT".

Task 1 : "TIC TAC TOE GAME"

This is a simple console based multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game.
Their are two players in the game:
Player X
Player O

Each player gets alternate turns.
They play their turn by entering the row and column number where they want to mark their turn.

First of all the function start displays the Tic Tac Toe table.
Then the display function takes a 2 dimentional array as a parameter and updates the table after every move.
The functions checkWin and checkDraw are boolean functions that return the status of the game (win or draw).
The computer also shows an error if an invalid move is done by any of the two players.

At last the function named Play_Again asks the user if he wants to play again and prompts the computer accordingly.
